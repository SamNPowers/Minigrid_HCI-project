# Inverse Reinforcement Learning on Minigrid

The aim of this project is to provide a tool to train an agent on Minigrid. The human player can make game demonstrations and then the agent is trained from these demonstrations using Inverse Reinforcement Learning techniques.

The IRL algorithms are based on the following paper:
*Extrapolating Beyond Suboptimal Demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning from Observations*
